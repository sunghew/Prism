<h2>The Vacationing Salesman</h2>
<ul>
	<li> Use: python interpreter python3 vacation.py</li>
	<li> Python is a easy-to-use scripting language</li>
	<li> The most important design was to be able to query common locations and get their relative distance from each other.</li>
	<li> Used geopy from https://github.com/geopy/geopy<li>
</ul>

<h2>Deck of Cards</h2>
<ul>
	<li> I wanted to make a generic deck of cards that I could use even if I decided to have a slightly different type of deck or even completely different cards.</li>
	<li> I have not made a framework before, so I was (perhaps am) somewhat confused. I decided to just implement an abstract class because Shuffle() and GetNextCard() should be the same for all decks.</li>
	<li>I would check if I am correctly getting random cards. That is, I would shuffle and draw all cards... perhaps a 10000 times to utilize the law of large numbers. </li>
</ul>

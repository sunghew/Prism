<h2>Deck of Cards</h2>
I wanted to make a generic deck of cards that I could use even if I decided to have a slightly different type of deck or even completely different cards.
I have not made a framework before, so I was (perhaps am) somewhat confused. I decided to just implement an abstract class because Shuffle() and GetNextCard() should be the same for all decks.
I would check if I am correctly getting random cards. That is, I would shuffle and draw all cards... perhaps a 10000 times to utilize the law of large numbers.
